Audrey is a simple single-user feed reader, focused on a no-frills reading experience. Audrey allows you to subscribe to [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) and [Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard)) feeds and read content in one place.

Audrey is self-hosted; you can set up an installation on your own server or cloud provider. There's no creepy harvesting of your data, and no algorithms to recommend new content.
